What to do for SEO?
 Page pre-rendering 

 req => 
  /products => 
    (return pre-rendered page) => 
      (then, hyderates with React code after loaded - so that app will become interactive)

    
------
2 Types of Pre-rendering 
  1. Static Generation: 
      The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request.

  2. Server-side Rendering: 
      The HTML is generated on each request.


Static Generation
--------------
  * pre-generate a page with all the data prepared on the server side 
  * all done during build time (npm run build or next build)
  * pages are prepared ahead of time
  * can be cached by the server 

  Example: Refer products.tsx 
  
Let's build the project to see SSG html 
  npm start
